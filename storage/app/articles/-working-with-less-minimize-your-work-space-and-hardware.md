	- lets start at the beginning: original setup (SHORT)
	- how I improved my work setup without knowing it
	
-  how you can get there


## The Ever-changing work location

If you are anything like me, you work from basically anywhere: In the office and at home. You work at your clients locations and on the commute. You work when you are in a plane or on a train or in a coffee shop.

It's great and you are lucky that you apparently have a job where this is possible.

## Hardware for every location
However for me, this comes with a drawback: I needed a lot of different hardware. While I did not have a set of hardware for every location, I did accumulate quite a bit of hardware.

Describe setup in only one section and in much less detail.


## Setup one: At home
At the time I was working at agencies most of the days so I did not have an office apart from my home office. Even though I did not spent most of my time at my home office, I had my best and advanced setup here. It does make sense, as this was the only environment I actually had control over.

- macbook 15" (I'd take this anywhere)
- cinema monitor 23" (I would use my macbook and cinema monitor at the same time, so my app palettes or a life preview of a website, etc. would be on the macbook and the main Photoshop window or code editor would be on the big cinema screen)
- big Wacom tablet (A4 drawing area)
- keyboard
- external HD

## Setup two: At agencies

I worked for agencies 3-5 days a week sitting in their office. Of course as a freelancer you rarely get your own desk and you normally bring your own hardware so my setup here was fairly reduced:

- mouse
- Wacom Bamboo tablet
- my 15" macbook
- sometimes I got an external monitor, sometimes not

## Setup three: The coffeeshop

Working in coffeeshops or on the go was even more minimal, I would mostly use my macbook and my mouse or just the track pad. This depended on whether I was sitting at a table or crammed into an airplane seat.

## The upside

So you might correctly assume that I had figured out a pretty nifty setup for the various locations where I would be working. I was making the most of every work space and getting the best possible setup.

However after working at a client on site for seven months I did not have many on site agency jobs but mostly worked for my own clients and did some remote gigs. Working from home is fine if it's a day a week, but when you are there five days petting the kittens and doing stuff around the house just becomes to much of a distraction.

I spent a month in a friend's office who was splitting up with his former partner, before the two of us found a new office. As I was coming there every day as a guest I was bringing my agency setup.

At the same time I was selling most of my furniture so my hardware at home was all packed in boxes, including the big tablet and cinema display. So when working from home I was also left with the agency setup.

After I moved into the new office I had started an on-site project so that I left most of my stuff in boxes.

## the downside

I noticed that somehow I was working more productive. I did not really need to setup anything, just open the macbook and attach the bamboo tablet.

I also got really good at drawing and working with the track pad. I had found a secret to optimizing your workspace: Don't change your setup.

What I had not noticed before is that by always changing the hardware I worked with I was constantly adapting to new hardware. While not impossible it certainly distracts from the actual work you do and means you will need some time until you are 100% productive.

Some of the changes I was constantly adapting to were the different tablets. While the big wacom lies in front of you and is used by moving your whole arm, like you would when drawing on a tablet, the bamboo is on my right side (instead of a mouse) and is used my only slightly moving my fingers. My hand mostly rests on the table.

Also changing from a two monitor to a one monitor setup meant I had to constantly change the Adobe tool palette. While you can save different setups, you brain still needs to adapt and you may loose the benefit of muscle memory, as in, when your brain thinks color palette, your arm "knows" where to move to.

In essence, minimising my setup to one I can use wherever I work allows me to immediately start being productive and gaining the benefit of muscle memory for common tasks.

## the changes

If you are interested, I made quite a bit of changes, first I sold my cinema display and my big wacom tablet as well as my keyboard.

I started cleaning up my notebooks hard drive and moving all design work to Google drive, so I would not need a hard drive for backups. Any code is stored on GitHub, pictures on Google photos and I use Spotify as my music library. Really if my Mac would die, I would not actually loose much.

After my amplifier died, I also discarded my boxes, now I only listen to music via (very good) headphones or the mediocre Mac speakers.

Basically the only hardware I have twice is the power cord, because I need one in my back least I forget to take it when I leave the house.

## Adapting my approach

I know that this will not work for everyone. I for example do not do movies or 3D, where you need much power and disk space.

But if you would have asked be before I would never have thought this change to be possible and positive for me either. What I am getting at is that while you might not be able to make the same changes it might be worth to slowly remove things from your setup and see if it works out. Who knows, maybe you enjoy the change as much as I do.

Also you should check again where you spent most of your time. While I spent most of my time in agencies, my master setup was at home. You should make sure that your setup works best, wherever you work the most.
