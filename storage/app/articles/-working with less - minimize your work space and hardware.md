# working with less - minimize your work space and hardware

## ever-changing work location

If you are anything like me, you work from basically anywhere. In the office and at home. You work at your clients locations and on the communte. When you are in a plane or on a train or in a coffee shop. 

It's great and you are lucky that you apparently have a job where this is possible. 

## hardware for every location

However for me, this comes with a drawback: You need a lot of different hardware. 

## Setup 1: at home

At the time I was working at agencies most of the days so I did not have an office apart from my home office.


- macbook 15" (I'd take this anywhere)
- cinema monitor 23" (I would use my macbook and cibema monitor at the same time, so my app paletts or a life preview of the website, etc. would be on the macbook and the main Photoshop window or code editor would be on the big cibema screeb
- wacom tablet medium size (A4 drawing area)
- keyboard
- external HD

## Setup 2: at agencies

I worked for agencies 3-5 days a week sitting in their office. Of course as a freelancer you rarely get your own desk and you normally bring your own hardware soy setup here was:

- mouse
- wacom Baboo tablet
- my macbook 15"
- sometimes I got an external monitor, sometimes not

## Setup three: the coffeeshop


Working in coffeeshops or on the go was even more minimal, I would mostly use my macbook and my mouse or just the track pad. This mostly depends on whether you are sitting at a table or crammed into an airplane seat.

## The upside

So you might correctly assume that I had figured out a pretty nifty setup for the various locations where I would be working. I was making the most of every work space and getting the best possible setup.

However after working at a client on site for seven months I did not have many on site agency jobs but mostly worked for my own clients and did some remote gigs. Working from home is fine if it's a day a week, but when you are there five days petting the kittens and doing stuff around the house just becomes to much of a distraction. 

I spent a month in a friend's office who was splitting up with his former partner, before the two of us found a new office. As I was coming there every day as a guest I was bringing my agency setup. 

At the same time I was selling most of my furniture so my hardware at home was all packed in boxes, including the big tablet and cinema display. So when working from home I was also left with the agency setup.

After I moved into the new office I had started an on-site project so that I left most of my stuff in boxes. 

## the downside

I noticed that somehow I was working more productive. I did not really need to setup anything, just open the macbook and attach the bamboo tablet. 

I also got really good at drawing and working with the track pad. I had found a secret to optimizing your workspace: Don't change your setup.

What I had not noticed before is that by always changing the hardware I worked with I was constantly adapting to new hardware. While not impossible it certainly distracts from the actual work you do and means you will need some time until you are 100% productive. 

Some of the changes I was constantly adapting to were the different tablets. While the big wacom lies in front of you and is used by moving your whole arm, like you would when drawing on a tablet, the bamboo is on my right side (instead of a mouse) and is used my only slightly moving my fingers. My hand mostly rests on the table.

Also changing from a two monitor to a one monitor setup meant I had to constantly change the Adobe tool palette. While you can save different setups, you branin still needs to adapt and you may loose the benefit of muscle memory, as in, when your brain thinks color palette, your arm "knows" where to move to.

In essence, minimizing my setup to one I can use wherever I work allows me to immediately start being productive and gaining the benefit of muscle memory for common tasks.

## the changes

If you are interested, I made quite a bit of changes, first I sold my cinema display and my big wacom tablet as well as my keyboard. 

I started cleaning up my notebooks hard drive and moving ally design work to Google drive, so I would not need a hard drive for backups. Any code is stored on GitHub, pictures on Google photos and I use Spotify as my music library. Really if my Mac would die, I would not actually loose much.

After my amplifier died, I also discarded my boxes, now I only lissen to music via (very good) headphones or the mediocre Mac speakers.

Basically the only hardware I have twice is the power cord, because I need one in my back least I forget to take it when I leave the house.

## Adapting my approach

I know that this will not work for everyone. I for example do not do movies or 3D, where you need much power and disk space. But if you would have asked be before I would never have thought this change to be possible and positive for me either. What I am getting at is that while you might not be able to make the same changes it might be worth to slowly remove things from your setup and see if it works out. Who knows, maybe you enjoy the change as much as I do.
