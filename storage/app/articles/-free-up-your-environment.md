# working with less - minimize your work space and hardware

## ever-changing work location

If you are anything like me, you work from basically anywhere. In the office and at home. You work at your clients locations and on the communte. When you are in a plane or on a train or in a coffee shop. 

It's great and you are lucky that you apparently have a job where this is possible. 

## hardware for every location

However for me, this comes with a drawback: You need a lot of different hardware. 

## Setup 1: at home

At the time I was working at agencies most of the days so I did not have an office apart from my home office.


- macbook 15" (I'd take this anywhere)
- cinema monitor 23" (I would use my macbook and cibema monitor at the same time, so my app paletts or a life preview of the website, etc. would be on the macbook and the main Photoshop window or code editor would be on the big cibema screeb
- wacom tablet medium size (A4 drawing area)
- keyboard
- external HD

## Setup 2: at agencies

I worked for agencies 3-5 days a week sitting in their office. Of course as a freelancer you rarely get your own desk and you normally bring your own hardware soy setup here was:

- mouse
- wacom Baboo tablet
- my macbook 15"
- sometimes I got an external monitor, sometimes not

## Setup three: the coffeeshop


Working in coffeeshops or on the go was even more minimal, I would mostly use my macbook and my mouse or just the track pad.
