> Getting your data structure right can be one of the hardest parts of building your api.

While you can transform your database data into any formats using *transformers*, you will still need to figure out how to structure your data when it is sent back via your API. But at the same time you should keep an eye on storing your data in your database as flexible as possible, so that you do not have to change your database when adding more tables later on. While it is not impossible to complete redesign your database when you already have a full system, it is a pain and you should try to avoid it by any means.
