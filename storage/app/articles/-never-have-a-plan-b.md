TL;DR making backup plans means you are not trusting your plan a approach. So instead of making a plan b, spent some time tweaking plan a and than go all in.


## A fair warning
This is something I learned throughout my life so far. There are people who say that having an alternative let's them actually focus more because they are paralyzed by the fear of failure if there is no alternative.

I can not judge if this is really the case, but if you think you are like this, make sure you are not just making excuses for not going all in.

## making plans
Anything you do in life, that you think about beforehand is a planned thing. People tend to make plans. Meeting friends on the weekend? Organizing your business trip? Starting your own company? Those are all plans. 

Making plans is important, as it enables us to prepare for what is to come, so that we get to the optimal outcome.

But sometimes you are not sure whether or not your plans are going to work out. Better rent a movie in case your friends have other plans. An alternative slide with a different solution will be useful when the client does not like your first idea. Maybe you better take up a half time position, just in case your company idea does not take off.


## execution

Now that you made up your plan, it is time to execute on it, right? Execution is the crutial step, without execution your plan is worthless. Same for ideas, many people who come up with an idea for a startup think the idea is worth a lot, but it really is not. Gmail did not come up with online email services, twitter wasn't the first social network and Microsoft came to the computer market fairly late. The better your execution, the better your product. This is why MVPs (reference) are so helpful. If you have a fairly small scope it is much easier to excel at the execution level. 

But you know what, if your execution sucks, you can still jump to your alternative plan...

## going all in

It feels good to have this kind of backup, does it not? If you fail on executing it, you have something to move on to. But don't you think that maybe this missing fear of failure leads you to work just a little bit less towards your plan? If you had everything riding on this one idea, wouldn't you maybe put a bit more effort into it? And what if I tell you that I believe this little bit of effort could be the thing that distinguishes you from the next guy/girl who had pretty much the same idea.

In essence, if you come up with an alternative plan, you do not trust in your plan A. Why else would you need an alternative. If you already don't fully believe in your idea during the planning phase, it is near impossible to go entirely all in.

I have experienced both and let me tell you, while going all definitely works very well, it is scary. If you don't thrive on risk you will have phases of horrible pressure, where you have no way of relaxing and forgetting your fear. 

The good thing however is that after a couple of those experiences you have a fairly good idea of what is a good plan, and when you need to put more work into it before you can go all in. Don't be fooled though, even if you go all in, there is no way of knowing if you will succeed in the end.

But then again without risking it you don't even have a chance to make it at all.
