> TL;DR When you are not in the business of building an atomic plant, don't stress to much about precision.

- technologies allows for precision
- people are not good a precision, but at "close enough" (design everyday things)
- when precision is possible, people concentrate to be very precise
- when precision is avoided, people can decide faster
- engineers like precision, don't let them design products
